# 🐳 Flask API on AWS Fargate (Terraform Powered)

This project demonstrates how to deploy a production-grade Python Flask application on **AWS Fargate** using **Terraform**, with full infrastructure as code and CI/CD-friendly setup.

## ⚙️ Terraform Execution Order

1. `terraform init` – Initialize the backend and providers
2. `terraform plan` – Review the execution plan
3. `terraform apply` – Provision the AWS resources
4. `make build-and-push` – Build Docker image and push to ECR
5. `make ecs-redeploy` – Force ECS to redeploy with new image
6. `make test-health` – Get public IP and test `/health` endpoint

---

## ✅ Terraform File Relationships

```
main.tf → loads → all *.tf files
variables.tf ← terraform.tfvars
outputs.tf → used by Makefile (ECR URL, cluster/service names)

cluster.tf → defines ECS cluster
iam.tf → defines task execution role
network.tf → defines VPC, subnets, SGs
task_definition.tf → depends on IAM role and ECR image
service.tf → depends on cluster + task definition + network
```

---

## 🚫 .gitignore Suggestions

```gitignore
# Terraform state and plan
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
*.tfplan
.terraform/

# Environment config
.env
terraform.tfvars

# Logs
crash.log
```

---

## 🔐 Security Tip

Never commit `terraform.tfvars` or state files containing sensitive data. Use remote state (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB) and secrets manager for production use.

## 🔄 ECS Service Lifecycle Commands (Makefile)

| Command               | Description                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `make stop-service`   | Scale ECS service down to 0 tasks (pause)       |
| `make start-service`  | Resume ECS service with 1 or more tasks         |
| `make delete-service` | Forcefully delete the ECS service configuration |
| `make destroy`        | Destroy all Terraform-managed infrastructure    |

**Tip:** You can scale with custom count:

```bash
make start-service DESIRED_COUNT=3
```
